# Data-Scrapping
Data scraping, also known as web scraping, is the process of importing information from a website into a spreadsheet or local file saved on your computer. Itâ€™s one of the most efficient ways to get data from the web, and in some cases to channel that data to another website. 

Popular uses of data scraping include:
1.Research for web content/business intelligence
2.Pricing for travel booker sites/price comparison sites
3.Finding sales leads/conducting market research by crawling public data sources (e.g. Yell and Twitter)
4.Sending product data from an e-commerce site to another online vendor (e.g. Google Shopping)
